#### ...What up, virtual onlooker?

We are **Sleepy Gonzales**. Very few people know who we are at this point in time, but we're hoping to change that in the coming years of this project. At this point in time, the formula for Sleepy Gonzales is:

Allyson + Cristian + Beni Hobson-Dimas = **Amateur Indie Band!!!**

We are 19 and 20 years old. If you combine our ages, you can still get a healthy human being (59 years old) and that makes us feel young.

If you're wondering what our name means or how we chose it, you're in luck. In this first post, we reveal its underwhelming origins. As you may have guessed, our band name is a play on words of the Looney Tunes character *Speedy* Gonzales:

The way that the 'p' in 'Sleepy' turned to an 'l' to make 'Sleepy' can be explained by the words of Ernest Hemingway:

> "All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard" - The Old Man and the Sea

And that is exactly how Cristian and Beni spent the mornings they did not have to wake up for school or work. Their sloppy morning presence, especially their unruly bedheads, earned them the nickname *Sleepy Gonzales* from their father.

What was perfect about the name for us is that Sleepy Gonzales' music is generally smooth and melodious, with touches of dissonance, which produces a strange dreamlike sound. Also, many of our band's lyrical themes explore the freedom of being a child, nostalgia, and difficulty moving forward. This explains our attachment to the pun on a cartoon which we loved watching growing up.

Also, Beni and Cristian are half-Mexican.

We're excited to see how our music changes over the years, as well as ourselves.
